# FUTURE\_CS\_01 - Web Application Security Testing (OWASP Juice Shop)

## \## 📌 Overview

As part of my cybersecurity internship with Future Interns, this task focused on Web Application Security Testing using intentionally vulnerable apps like OWASP Juice Shop and DVWA.
The goal was to simulate real-world penetration testing and practice identifying vulnerabilities mapped to the OWASP Top 10.

## \## ✅ Key Highlights

* Deployed OWASP Juice Shop in Docker on Kali Linux
* Configured OWASP ZAP to intercept and scan traffic
* Detected vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection and XSS
* Successfully exploited and completed the Admin Login challenge

## \## 🎯 Skills Gained

* Web application penetration testing
* Knowledge of OWASP Top 10 threats

## \## 🛠️ Tools Used

* OWASP Juice Shop
* DVWA
* OWASP ZAP
* Burp Suite (Community Edition)
* Kali Linux

## \## 📁 Deliverables

* Report.pdf - Vulnerability Assessment Report
* screenshots/ - Evidence of findings and tool outputs
* (Optional) ZAP/Burp scan reports
